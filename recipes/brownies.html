        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These brownies only require one bowl and come together in minutes!</p>
        <p>They're rich, dense, and fudgy with a gorgeous crinkly top that put boxed mixes to shame.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 tbs of butter</li>
            <li>1 1/4 c granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 c + 2 tbs unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1/4 rounded tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large cold eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 c all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 c chopped walnuts or pecans (optional, but not really)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.</li>
            <li>Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering.</li>
            <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.</li>
            <li>Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Don’t worry if it looks gritty; it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.</li>
            <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot.</li>
            <li>Stir in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.</li>
            <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir in nuts if using.</li>

            <h4>Bake Brownies</h4>
            <li>Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes. You can test doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished baking if it comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before removing from the pan — this step is essential and helps the brownies set. Cut into 16 squares.</li>
        </ol>
